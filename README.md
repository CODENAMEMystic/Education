Git Repo for Software Application Development.

## In the next two months, I want to build software that...
* People can play world wide either with or against others
* Allows people to chat by text with other people who speak different languages with real time translations
* A caclulator with adjustable variables for any use ex: calculating necesary achievements for games (how many points do I need to get here, and at X rate how long will it take)
* Allows users to view and interact with a map realtime useful for DayZ
